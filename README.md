# Crawl-Google-Play
This Python script is used for crawling google play.

This code is using library play_scraper. You can install it from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/play-scraper/">here</a>
or you can run <b>pip install play-scraper</b> in the command line

## NOTE: All the outputs of this library functions are JSON code

This code takes a list of apps names from an Excel file, search google play to find them and return some details about them.
Of course you change what details you want to see, since the output is JSON code so it's very easy to deal with it.


### I've recently added a new <a href="https://github.com/MOHED1224/Crawl-App-Store">repository</a> for crawling App-Store.
